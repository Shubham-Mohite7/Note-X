## 🚀 Key Features

*   🎨 **Stunning Glassmorphism UI:** A sleek, modern interface with blur effects and a responsive design that looks great on any device.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into three main files, keeping the structure simple and easy to navigate.

```
note-x/
├── 📄 index.html   # The main HTML file containing the structure for all views.
├── 🎨 style.css     # All styles, including animations, responsive design, and theme variables.
└── ⚙️ script.js     # All JavaScript logic for routing, dynamic rendering, and interactivity.
```

*   `index.html`: Serves as the single entry point. It contains the layout for all "pages" or "views" (Home, Search, Profile, etc.), which are toggled by JavaScript to simulate a multi-page application.
*   `style.css`: A comprehensive stylesheet that defines the entire visual identity. It uses CSS variables for easy theming (light/dark modes) and includes all responsive media queries.
*   `script.js`: The brain of the application. It handles:
    *   **View Management:** Showing and hiding different sections based on user navigation.
    *   **Dynamic Rendering:** Generating HTML for note cards, search results, and analytics from the sample data.
    *   **Event Handling:** Managing all user interactions, from form submissions to button clicks.
    *   **Chart.js Integration:** Rendering and updating all data visualizations.
